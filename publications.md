## Research

### LLM Reasoning Framework for Security Applications

During my MSc in Cybersecurity at IU International University of Applied Sciences (Germany), I developed a novel **LLM Reasoning Framework** that integrates deep-think stages with self-reflection mechanisms directly into LLM hidden states without requiring fine-tuning.

**Key Areas:**
- **LLM Security & Reasoning** - Exploring how advanced reasoning capabilities can be leveraged for threat detection
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection** - Using deep learning for security analysis
- **Adversarial AI** - Building robust systems against prompt injection and adversarial attacks
- **Zero-day Discovery** - Applying self-supervised learning for vulnerability research

### Model Surgery Techniques for AI-Powered Security

Research focused on guiding AI-powered code generation and vulnerability detection through model surgery techniques. This work involved developing approaches that don't require traditional fine-tuning while maintaining performance.

- Payload obfuscation

### Active Directory Attack Frameworks
Research and implementation of advanced Active Directory exploitation techniques, including:
- Kerberos attacks (Golden/Silver tickets, Kerberoasting)
- NTLM relay attacks
- Domain persistence mechanisms
- Lateral movement frameworks

### Binary Exploitation Tools
Custom exploitation tools for binary analysis and vulnerability research:
- Fuzzing frameworks
- ROP chain generators
- Shellcode generators
- Exploit automation
