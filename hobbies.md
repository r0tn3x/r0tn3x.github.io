# Hobbies

## Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions

CTF competitions are more than just a hobby—they're my training ground for real-world offensive security. I regularly compete in various CTF events, focusing on:

- **Binary Exploitation** - PWN challenges are my specialty
- **Reverse Engineering** - Cracking binaries and understanding malware
- **Web Security** - Finding and exploiting web vulnerabilities
- **Cryptography** - Breaking encryption and crypto implementations
- **Forensics** - Analyzing artifacts and recovering hidden data

CTFs keep my skills sharp and expose me to new attack techniques. Every competition teaches something new that I can apply in red team operations.

## Gaming

When I'm not breaking into systems professionally, I enjoy gaming as a way to unwind and stay strategic. I play a variety of games including:

- **Strategy Games** - Games that require planning and tactical thinking
- **Competitive Shooters** - Fast-paced action and team coordination  
- **RPGs** - Deep storylines and character progression
- **Puzzle Games** - Logical challenges and problem-solving

Gaming and hacking share a lot in common—both require patience, creativity, and thinking outside the box. Plus, it's a great way to decompress after long red team engagements.

## Continuous Learning

The cybersecurity landscape never stops evolving, so neither do I. I'm constantly:

- Reading security research papers and blog posts
- Experimenting with new exploitation techniques
- Building custom tools and malware samples
- Following the latest vulnerabilities and zero-days
- Contributing to security communities
