# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Dilanka Kaushal Hewage**, better known in the security community as **r0tn3x**. I'm a Red Team Operator at Dubai Health Authority, passionate about offensive security, reverse engineering, and breaking things (legally, of course).

## What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Red Team Operations** - Simulating real-world adversaries to test organizational defenses
- **Reverse Engineering** - Taking apart binaries to understand how they tick
- **Binary Exploitation** - Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities at the lowest level
- **Malware Development** - Creating custom tools and payloads for offensive operations
- **CTF Player** - Competing in Capture The Flag competitions worldwide

## Background

I hold an **MSc in Cybersecurity** from IU International University of Applied Sciences in Germany, where I researched LLM reasoning frameworks for security applications. My work involved developing novel approaches for guiding AI-powered code generation and vulnerability detection through model surgery techniques.

During my academic journey, I developed the **LLM Reasoning Framework** - a system that integrates deep-think stages with self-reflection mechanisms directly into LLM hidden states without requiring fine-tuning. Pretty cool stuff if you're into AI security!

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity:
- **LLM Security & Reasoning** - Exploring how advanced reasoning capabilities can be leveraged for threat detection
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection** - Using deep learning for security analysis
- **Adversarial AI** - Building robust systems against prompt injection and adversarial attacks
- **Zero-day Discovery** - Applying self-supervised learning for vulnerability research
