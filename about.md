## About Me

Hey there! I'm **Dilanka Kaushal Hewage**, better known in the security community as **r0tn3x**. I'm a Red Team Operator at Dubai Health Authority, passionate about offensive security, reverse engineering, and breaking things (legally, of course).

### What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Red Team Operations** - Simulating real-world adversaries to test organizational defenses
- **Reverse Engineering** - Taking apart binaries to understand how they tick
- **Binary Exploitation** - Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities at the lowest level
- **Malware Development** - Creating custom tools and payloads for offensive operations
- **CTF Player** - Competing in Capture The Flag competitions worldwide

### Background

I hold an **MSc in Cybersecurity** from IU International University of Applied Sciences in Germany, where I researched LLM reasoning frameworks for security applications. My work involved developing novel approaches for guiding AI-powered code generation and vulnerability detection through model surgery techniques.

During my academic journey, I developed the **LLM Reasoning Framework** - a system that integrates deep-think stages with self-reflection mechanisms directly into LLM hidden states without requiring fine-tuning. Pretty cool stuff if you're into AI security!

### Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity:
- **LLM Security & Reasoning** - Exploring how advanced reasoning capabilities can be leveraged for threat detection
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection** - Using deep learning for security analysis
- **Adversarial AI** - Building robust systems against prompt injection and adversarial attacks
- **Zero-day Discovery** - Applying self-supervised learning for vulnerability research

### Certifications

I'm proud to hold several industry certifications including:
- OSEE (Offensive Security Exploitation Expert)
- OSED (Offensive Security Exploit Developer)
- CRTL (Certified Red Team Lead)
- CRTO (Certified Red Team Operator)
- OSEP (Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester)
- OSCE (Offensive Security Certified Expert)
- OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
- CRTE (Certified Red Team Expert)
- CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional)
- CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist)
- CAPE (Certified Active Directory Pentesting Expert)
- CEH - (Certified Ethical Hacker - v13)

### Philosophy

I believe in **responsible disclosure** and using offensive security skills to make systems more secure. Every exploit found, every vulnerability discovered, and every defense bypassed is an opportunity to build stronger security for everyone.

This blog is my way of sharing knowledge, documenting research, and contributing back to the security community that has taught me so much.
